# Detection of Diseases in Grape Plant

Comparison of CNN and SVM Model for training an image classification system, that can detect if a grape plant is healthy or diseased.

The dataset is taken from New Plant Diseases Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) on Kaggle. Since the original dataset was too big, for the sake of lesser training time, a small portion of it was extracted, pertaining only to grapes.

SVM -  84.2%
